# FF7SND
Final Fantasy VII Audio Extraction app ( originally made by Qhimm.com )

## What's new
This version inherits the GUI from FF7SND, but has been completely rewritten in C# with VS2019 in mind.

Additionally this version supports multiple file extraction by allowing to select multiple entries.
Upon clicking Extraction the app will now ask for to choose a Folder where to extract the selected files.

For an easier batch extraction, is it possible to select all entries by using the `CTRL+A` keyboard shortcut.
